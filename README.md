This is my first game ever!

About the game: 

-- Classic 2D platformer mechanics.
-- Collect coins while progressing through the levels.
-- Reach the victory flag to win!

The game was built with godot, its my first time to use it ever btw ^^

I built the whole game in just one day! it took me more than 8.5 hours!
